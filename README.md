# Repository for Gauge imagery

The overarching purpose of this codebase was to link the Australian HRS stream gauging network to the Australian Geoscience Datacube in order to examine the relationship between stream discharge (flow) and inundated extent (as observed from space). 

Five notebooks were created for this investigation. Four notebooks are based on streamflow data. One notebook was created to investigate linking the AGDC to borehole water level data.

Code written in May 2017 by Erin Telfer with support from Leo Lymburner, Damien Ayers and Biswajit Bala.
The notebook was completed as a graduate program project at Geoscience Australia. If you find an error or if you have any suggestions, please contact erin.telfer@ga.gov.au. Alternatively, please contact leo.lymburner@ga.gov.au.
